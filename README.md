# TUTORIAL

# DESCRIPTION

RBTTool is a password cracking tool based on the principle of rainbow table, it can generate him own rainbow table that it use for cracking hashes.

This step is not required, but it may make it easier to crack.
To find it you can use hash-identifier or https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=Analyse_hash() online hash identifier
